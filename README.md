## 🔍 Project Overview

This project implements a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model using the Encoder-Decoder architecture for machine translation. It leverages an attention mechanism to improve translation accuracy by learning to focus on relevant parts of the source sentence while generating the target sentence. The model is designed to be flexible for use in a variety of language translation tasks.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a machine translation system using deep learning and NLP.
- Use the Encoder-Decoder architecture with attention mechanism.
- Train on a parallel corpus (e.g., English to French translation).
- Preprocess and clean the text data for model training.
- Provide inference functionality for translating sentences.
- Evaluate the model using BLEU score or other metrics.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Machine-Translation-using-Encoder-Decoder-Architecture
cd Machine-Translation-using-Encoder-Decoder-Architecture

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
```python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3. Install Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
### 4. Preprocess Data
The data preprocessing can be done by running the preprocessing script that will clean and tokenize the text data.
```
python preprocess_data.py
```

### 5. Train the Model
You can train the model using the following script. Make sure to provide the correct paths for your training and validation data.
```
python train_model.py
```
### 6. Run the Flask Application (for Inference)
Once the model is trained, you can use the Flask app to serve the translation model and perform inference.
```
  python app.py
```
Access the app at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

### 🧑‍💻 Example Usage
Translate English to French: 
```
from models.encoder_decoder import EncoderDecoderModel

# Load the trained model
model = EncoderDecoderModel.load_model("models/model_weights.h5")

# Translate an English sentence
translated_sentence = model.translate("How are you?")
print(translated_sentence)
```
### 📊 Evaluation
```
python evaluate_model.py
```
